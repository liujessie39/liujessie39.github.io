									<p>
										During my mechanical engineering MS program at Georgia Institute of Technology, I've been 
										working in the <a href=https://epics.me.gatech.edu target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EPICS Lab</a> 
										doing research to complete my thesis. As a part of my exploration finding a topic for my thesis before landing on gender equity in design teams, 
										I spent some time shadowing and learning about operation of our laser powder bed fusion machine and 
										post-processing and cleaning methods for internal features and channels. I also competed in the 2022 
										<a href="projects.html#sicpea" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Student Innovation Competition - Promoting Equity & Access (SICPEA)</a> where 
										my team and I were awarded 1st place for our research and policy change proposal. 
									</p>
									
									<h3>Thesis Work  - The Effects of Gender and Internal/External Factors on Task Allocation and Interest in Engineering Design Teams</h3>
									<p>
										The motivation behind this work is that due to a variety of complex factors, 
										women are more likely to only do non-technical tasks within an engineering team, reinforcing lower 
										self-efficacy rates in women in STEM and their lower retention rates in engineering programs. I wanted to find out 
										how the varying factors that inform this inequitable task allocation phenomenon comparatively influenced the phenomenon and 
										interacted with each other. Data for 
										my study was collected through surveys to see how students' interest level and self-efficacy react 
										to different project topics and being assigned certain roles within a design team. 
									</p>
									<p>
										Study results contributed insights on how women leadership representation can encourage women in STEM, relative impacts of 
										factors influencing task choice on design teams, and the ways gender influences people's perception of non-technical tasks on
										design teams. These findings could go on to inform curriculum development, pedagogy, and management methods. It's been 
										exciting to learn about and work on a topic that may have important implications to improving 
										gender equity within STEM, a topic that I am personally very passionate about. To see some of 
										my other work in researching gender equity, check out <a href="projects.html#sicpea">SICPEA</a>.

									<p>
										<a href=https://2110.me.gatech.edu target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ME 2110 - Creative Decisions and Design</a> - is an undergraduate sophomore-level class at 
										Georgia Tech that teaches the engineering design process to students through a hands-on 
										prototyping class ending in a robotics competition. I worked as an undergraduate teaching 
										assistant as well, supervising the open studio hours in the class makerspace/woodshop. 
									</p>
									<p>
										As a graduate teaching assistant, in addition to supervising open studio hours, I also 
										taught a lab section as a teaching assistant. I helped students with both 
										technical skills - the Arduino, shop tools, and design feedback - and course content - 
										design methods, tools, and best practices. I really enjoyed working with students, guiding them 
										through areas they needed help with and making what is one of the most stressful undergraduate classes 
										both fun and educational for them. As a GTA, I was also a judge during the final competition and helped 
										run various aspects of class and final competition logistics. 
									</p>
									<p>
										In my second semester as a GTA, I was also a Head TA for the course. I'd begun preparations for 
										this role the semester before, shadowing the prior two Head TAs during meetings and assisting with 
										final competition preparations to smooth the transition. As one of the two Head TAs, I oversaw 
										all the undergraduate and graduate TAs, ran weekly meetings to coordinate final competition preparations 
										and lab sessions, made sure open studio was properly supervised and stocked, 
										and organized event logistics for the final competition. The final competition involved working with 
										the ME department to reserve venues, catering, inviting sponsors and judges, and coordinating logistics 
										for around 250 students, 30 TAs, and 12 faculty members.

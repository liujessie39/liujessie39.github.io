										<h1>Extracurriculars</h1>

									<p>
										Outside of academics, I enjoy a variety of hobbies and extracurricular activities. I spent some time in undergrad as a part of the Georgia Tech 
										RoboJackets on their RoboCup and Outreach teams, mentoring high school robotics teams and creating training materials for K-12 robotics 
										programs. I've been an active part of the Georgia Tech Chorale, with some hiatuses during internships and COVID-19, since Fall 2017. I've sung as a part of church choirs and even once with the Atlanta 
										Symphony Orchestra when the Georgia Tech choirs were invited for a few Polar Express in Concert performances. Music for me, as a vocalist and 
										pianist, is something I enjoy very much and hope to continue pursuing even after graduation. On my own time, I enjoy cooking, embroidery, and 
										video games.

										The extracurricular I've been most involved with is <a href=https://www.gabestrobotics.org target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Georgia BEST Robotics</a>, 
										a middle and high school robotics competition. I competed as a high schooler and joined the planning committee upon graduation. 
										The Georgia BEST Hub is unique amongst BEST Inc.  
										in that it's run primarily by alumni, whereas other hubs are run mostly by universities and other similar organizations. I first began 
										as a planning committee member, becoming Co-Director in 2018, but stepping down to Hub Coordinator in 2022 in order to better focus on 
										my graduate studies. 
									</p>
									<p>
										As a part of the planning committee, I've acted as event manager and volunteer coordinator since 2018, managing as many as 20 
										schools and 60 volunteers each season. We coordinate events, competitions, training, kit and material distribution, and volunteer 
										hospitality. During my time as Co-Director, I managed communications and registration with all the schools and teachers as well. 
										This organization is very important to me because it provides a high quality and free STEM experience for students 
										across the state. BEST provides all building materials to students each year and no participation fees are collected from schools. 
										This experience has taught me a lot about project management, leadership, and communication. Seeing the students having fun 
										during our events and watching their robots succeed is an absolute highlight of my year.
